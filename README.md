## penguins-testdata

This repository contains a bunch of NMR data which are used for tests and documentation of the Python 3 [penguins](https://github.com/yongrenjie/penguins) package.

They are kept in a separate repository because the files are big and I don't want to clutter the main repository with the actual files.

There is also a `nmrdata.zip` file which is provided as "sample data" for people to use when following the tutorial in the documentation.

In practice, the main repository contains this one as a submodule.
